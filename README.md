# Big-Data-Project

This project uses a sub-set of 10 object categories from the complete CIFAR-10 dataset. Each category contains 1000 training images and 100 testing images, which are stored in two 4D arrays. The corresponding category labels are also provided. The size of each image is fixed at 32x32x3, corresponding to height, width and colour channel respectively. The first dimension is the height of the image, the second dimension is the width, the third dimension is the colour channels (RGB), and the fourth dimension is the samples. <br>
I used the training images to train my models, and the testing images to evaluate them. The learning algorithms used are:<br>
• K-Mean<br>
• Gaussian Mixture Model<br>
• Principal Component Analysis<br>
• Linear Discriminative Analysis<br>
• Support Vector Machine<br>
• Neural Networks<br>
I have uploaded an HTML file to show how the file looks in a Jupyter notebook.<br>
I have also included the final report summarizing my proposed method and the results.
